- 👋 Hi, I’m @gmitchell3
- 👀 I’m interested in Ubuntu/Linux and MAC apps and tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to install and setup Home Assistant on my new Ubuntu desktop residing on an old iMAC.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate at this time but maybe in the future.
- 📫 How to reach me - not sure what to put here just yet.
